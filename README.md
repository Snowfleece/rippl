# Rippl
Rippl (Recursively Inferred Pure-functional programming Language) is a functional language that leverages the safety and elegance of pure languages like Haskell into a concise and powerful set of core language constructs. As the name suggests, Rippl is a pure language and thus does not have any mutable state and expressions have no side-effects. The language supports first-class functions, partial application, immutability, a strong static type system, lazy semantics, and list comprehensions.
